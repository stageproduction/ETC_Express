I used an ESP32 DOIT Dev Kit 1. Could be built with anything that has a network connection.
You will need a MIDI cable/jack and a resistor (220 ohm) on pin 4, pin 2 to ground and pin 3 to 5V

An LED can be added to pin 13(or you can change it to any other pin) and it will light up when it sends data to the console. This will help with troubleshooting.

You can 3D print an enclosure from here:
